# Rock-Game-by-HephaestusHex
A text based game of the rock cycle.

THIS IS NOT A VIRUS.

If you still think it is a virus(it is not.), then don't run. Have fun not playing it.

Also, what would I gain???

If you think it isn't (thank you),
read on

To run the game, click the code button and click download the zip file.

Right click the zip file and click the extract button. 
Then click on the new folder until you reach the exe file and the python file(.py)

Run exe if on windows

OR

If you are afraid of viruses (there are none, but if so...)

Install python and run the file.

If on linux install python3. 

apt-based systems
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
  sudo apt-get install python3

Then navigate to the directory with python file then run

python3 main.py

(I think if you are using Linux, you would have an idea of what you are doing.)

On macOS install python3 latest release from python.org

open terminal then navigate to directory with the python file then run

python3 main.py
